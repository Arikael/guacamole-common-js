# mirror of guacamole-common-js

This repo is just a simple mirror of https://github.com/apache/guacamole-client/tree/master/guacamole-common-js   
Only the js part of the guacamole-client repository is included here to publish it to npmjs

It does automatically download the sources from guacamole's GitHub repo and builds a CommonJS, ES Module and a plain js build.

install it like `npm i @arikael@guacamole-common-js`

This package doesn't add or change anything about guacamole-common-js   
It just packages and publishes it, so one can use it easily in a npm project

For more detailed documentation of the API etc. have a look at https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/guacamole-common-js.html
